# Multi-node with Neutron

Note: Default operating system is Ubuntu. If you would like CentOS, set env var REPO_OS=centos7

## Nodes

The multi-node environments will have four machines `controller`, `compute1`, `compute2`, and `compute3`.

## Networking setup

Changes need to be made to the multi-neutron.rb and the environments\vagrant-multi-neutron.json or environments\vagrant-multi-centos7-neutron.json file.
